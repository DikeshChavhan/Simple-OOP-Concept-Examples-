# ðŸŽ“ Student Management System - OOP in Python

This project is a simple **Student & Teacher Management System** designed to demonstrate all major **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python. It can serve as a great educational resource or GitHub showcase for students and beginners.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Create Student and Teacher objects
- Add student grades and calculate average
- Display personalized details using polymorphism
- Encapsulate sensitive data (e.g., student ID and grades)
- Abstract base class for enforcing structure

## ðŸ§  OOP Concepts Used

| Concept         | Implementation Example                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Class & Object** | Classes like `Student`, `Teacher`, and instances like `student1` |
| **Encapsulation** | Private attributes `__student_id`, `__grades`           |
| **Inheritance**   | `Student` and `Teacher` inherit from `Person`           |
| **Abstraction**   | Abstract class `Person` with abstract method `get_details()` |
| **Polymorphism**  | `get_details()` behaves differently in each class       |
